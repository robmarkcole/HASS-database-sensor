# HASS-database-sensor
Custom component for displaying the size of the HA database file, as described in [this feature request](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/database-size-sensor/40303)

Motivation: There are quite a few posts where people want to know the size of their HA database on disk. This custom component creates a sensor which displays the size (and perhaps other statistics in attributes) of the db file.
